Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
It plays an important role in driving the technology industry as it enables the creation of software applications and systems, that powers all the critical sectors of an economy, such as healthcare, education, power, commerce and entertainment.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i. The development of programming languages such as Fortran, C etc.
ii. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.
iii. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i. Requirements: this has to do with the gathering of information and creation of documentation to serve as user guide and system requirements for the developmental process.
ii. Design: this is the stage of creating a detailed flow of the software architecture and user flow.
iii. Implementation: this is the proper coding stage, where developers write code and build the software according to specifications.
iv. Testing: a stage where the software is tested both manually and programmatically, to ensure it meets with quality standard and functional requirements.
v. Deployment: the stage of releasing the software to users or customers.
vi. Maintainance: the stage of providing continous support to users, and also enhancing and updating parts of the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
i. Software Developer: responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
ii. Quality Assurance Engineer: oversees and ensures the software quality by designing and executing test plans.
iii. Project Manager: handles the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
i. IDEs are platform where the development and implementation of software takes place. it consists of tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g IntelliJ, VScode and Pycharm
ii. Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git, Subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
i. It improves accuracy and relevance
ii. It helps to guide the AI's behavior and control the style, tone, and format of its responses.
iii. It enhances user experience.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
