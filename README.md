Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
It plays an important role in driving the technology industry as it enables the creation of software applications and systems, that powers all the critical sectors of an economy, such as healthcare, education, power, commerce and entertainment.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a. The development of programming languages such as Fortran, C etc.
b. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.
c. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a. Requirements: this has to do with the gathering of information and creation of documentation to serve as user guide and system requirements for the developmental process.
b. Design: this is the stage of creating a detailed flow of the software architecture and user flow.
c. Implementation: this is the proper coding stage, where developers write code and build the software according to specifications.
d. Testing: a stage where the software is tested both manually and programmatically, to ensure it meets with quality standard and functional requirements.
e. Deployment: the stage of releasing the software to users or customers.
f. Maintainance: the stage of providing continous support to users, and also enhancing and updating parts of the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a. Software Developer: responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
b. Quality Assurance Engineer: oversees and ensures the software quality by designing and executing test plans.
c. Project Manager: handles the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
a. IDEs are platform where the development and implementation of software takes place. it consists of tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g IntelliJ, VScode and Pycharm
b. Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git, Subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a. Continous evolving of technologies
b. Unfeasible deadlines
c. Lack of proper communication and collaboration
d. Sudden changes in requirements midway into project implementation

Strategies to overcome them:
a. Dedicate time to continous learning of new technologies through online courses, tutorials, books, and conferences.
b. Learn to estimate task durations accurately and communicate potential delays to stakeholders.
c. Pay attention to others' perspectives and ask clarifying questions by using clear language.
d. The use of Agile methodologies to track capture, and record progresses as the project goes, it also helps to adapt to changing requirements.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a. Unit testing focuses on testing the smallest parts of the application in isolation, such as the functions, util classes, variables and methods.
    i. it helps to catch bugs early in the development cycle.
    ii. it improves and ensures code quality.
    iii. it leads to faster development and helps the developer to quickly test changes made to the code.
b. Integration testing focuses on testing the interactions between different units or components of the software.
    i. It helps to verify and ensure that the integrated components work together as expected.
    ii. it helps to catche bugs that arise from the interaction between different components.
c. System testing verifies that the system meets its specified requirements and functions as intended in a production-like environment.
    i. it is used to assess performance of the system under various loads and conditions.
    ii. helps to simulate real-world scenarios to identify potential issues that may arise in production.
d. Acceptance testing is typically performed by the end-users or customers themselves.
    i. for business alignment and user's satisfaction
    ii. it helps to check if the system is easy to use and understand for the end users.
 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
a. It improves accuracy and relevance
b. It helps to guide the AI's behavior and control the style, tone, and format of its responses.
c. It enhances user experience.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt - "Write something about animals."

clear prompt - "Compose a 200-word summary about the migration patterns of monarch butterflies"

The clear prompt is more specific and has a clear subject.
